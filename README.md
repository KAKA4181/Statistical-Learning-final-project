## Data Mining on Bank Direct Marketing
### Introduction:
This is a self-constructed neural network (1-hidden-layer and 2-hidden-layers) without using any framework, such as Pytorch, Tensorflow and etc. This model is based on classic hand-written digits dataset MNIST.
### Requirement:

## Dataset:

Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.  

e.g. y - has the client subscribed a term deposit? (binary: 'yes', 'no')Â
